This project integrates an SQL database with a front-end and back-end system to manage staff records. It includes features for hiring new staff by capturing details like name, position, and start date, with updates made directly to the DH_STAFF table. Users can view all staff records, displaying relevant information such as names, roles, and IDs, and update specific details like job titles or status. The project also incorporates dynamic features such as real-time validation and UI updates. It is live and accessible here: https://a2-dbs.vercel.app/.
